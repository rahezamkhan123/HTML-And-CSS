    <h1>WOMANS DAY</h1>

    <p><i> March 8, 1990</i>,<b>Womans Day is being observed by SAARC </b>(South Asian Association for Regional
        Cooperation)
        consisting of seven countries, namely, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.
        The
        day was marked to focus on the problems of girl children in these countries. It is a pity that girl children
        especially in underdeveloped countries are victims of extreme negligence and dishonor. The birth of a girl child
        is
        looked upon by the parents as a cause of pity. They are deprived of proper nutrition, education, and economic
        facilities, and social status or honor. Superstitions and social and religious prejudices give rise to such
        distressing conditions. We must root out these prejudices and ensure a bright future for the girl children by
        giving
        them proper education. Moreover, womans rights must be established in social and economic fields.</p>

            <p>An aim is a goal or objective to achieve in life. In order to succeed
                in life, one
                must have a goal. My aim in
                life
                is
                to be a teacher. Teaching is a noble and responsible profession. I have come to know that the
                ever-increasing
                misery
                and
                distress, are due to the ignorance and illiteracy of the people of our country. So I have decided to
                spread
                education
                among the masses as much as possible within my humble power. As a teacher, I shall try my best to impart
                man-making
                education. Some say that money is the honey of life. But I do not agree with them. Rather, I think that
                morality
                is
                the
                real honey of life. I want to be a lovable and respectable person as a teacher in the future.</p>

            <p>Paper coffee filters were invented in Germany by <b>Melitta Bentz in 1908 </b>and are commonly used for
                drip
                brew
                all
                over the world. In 1954 the Wigomat, invented by<i> Gottlob Widmann</i>, was patented in Germany being
                the
                first
                electrical
                drip brewer.[2] Drip brew coffee makers replaced the coffee percolator in the 1970s due to the
                percolators'
                tendency
                to over-extract coffee, thereby making it bitter. One benefit of paper filters is that the used grounds
                and
                the
                filter may be disposed of together, without a need to clean the filter.</p>

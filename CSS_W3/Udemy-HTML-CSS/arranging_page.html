        <p>An aim is a goal or objective to achieve in life. In order to succeed
            in life, one
            must have a goal. My aim in
            life
            is
            to be a teacher. Teaching is a noble and responsible profession. I have come to know that the
            ever-increasing
            misery
            and
            distress, are due to the ignorance and illiteracy of the people of our country. So I have decided to spread
            education
            among the masses as much as possible within my humble power. As a teacher, I shall try my best to impart
            man-making
            education. Some say that money is the honey of life. But I do not agree with them. Rather, I think that
            morality
            is
            the
            real honey of life. I want to be a lovable and respectable person as a teacher in the future.</p>

        <p>Paper coffee filters were invented in Germany by <b>Melitta Bentz in 1908 </b>and are commonly used for drip
            brew
            all
            over the world. In 1954 the Wigomat, invented by<i> Gottlob Widmann</i>, was patented in Germany being the
            first
            electrical
            drip brewer.[2] Drip brew coffee makers replaced the coffee percolator in the 1970s due to the percolators'
            tendency
            to over-extract coffee, thereby making it bitter. One benefit of paper filters is that the used grounds and
            the
            filter may be disposed of together, without a need to clean the filter.</p>

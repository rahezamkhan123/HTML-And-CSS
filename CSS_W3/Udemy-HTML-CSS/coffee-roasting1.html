        <p>Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of green coffee beans into roasted coffee
            products.
            The roasting process is what produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the green coffee beans
            to
            change in taste. Unroasted beans contain similar if not higher levels of acids, protein, sugars, and
            caffeine as
            those that have been roasted, but lack the taste of roasted coffee beans due to the Maillard and other
            chemical
            reactions that occur during roasting.</p>
        <p>Coffee tends to be roasted close to where it will be consumed, as green coffee is more stable than roasted
            beans.[1] The vast majority of coffee is roasted commercially on a large scale, but small-scale commercial
            roasting has grown significantly with the trend toward "single-origin" coffees served at specialty shops.
        </p>
        <p>The first recorded implements for roasting coffee beans were thin pans made from metal or porcelain, used in
            the 15th century in the Ottoman Empire and Greater Persia. In the 19th century, various patents were awarded
            in the U.S. and Europe for commercial roasters, to allow for large batches of coffee. In the 1950s just as
            instant coffee was becoming a popular coffee drink, speciality coffee-houses began opening to cater to the
            connoisseur, offering a more traditionally brewed beverage. In the 1970s, more speciality coffee houses were
            founded, ones that offered a variety of roasts and beans from around the world. In the 1980s and 1990s, the
            gourmet coffee industry experienced great growth. This trend continued into the 21st century.</p>

        <h1>WOMANS DAY</h1>

        <p><i> March 8, 1990</i>,<b>Womans Day is being observed by SAARC </b>(South Asian Association for Regional
            Cooperation)
            consisting of seven countries, namely, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the
            Maldives.
            The
        <blockquote> day was marked to focus on the problems of girl children in these countries. It is a pity that girl
            children
            especially in underdeveloped countries are victims of extreme negligence and dishonor. The birth of a girl
            child is
            looked upon by the parents as a cause of pity. They are deprived of proper nutrition, education, and
            economic
            facilities, and social status or honor. Superstitions and social and religious prejudices give rise to such
            distressing conditions. We must root out these prejudices and ensure a bright future for the girl children
            by
            giving
            them proper education</blockquote>. Moreover, womans rights must be established in social and economic
        fields.</p>

    <h1>MY AIM IN LIFE</h1>
    An aim is a goal or objective to achieve in life. In order to succeed in life, one must have a goal. My aim in life
    is
    to be a teacher. Teaching is a noble and responsible profession. I have come to know that the ever-increasing misery
    and
    distress, are due to the ignorance and illiteracy of the people of our country. So I have decided to spread
    education
    among the masses as much as possible within my humble power. As a teacher, I shall try my best to impart man-making
    education. Some say that money is the honey of life. But I do not agree with them. Rather, I think that morality is
    the
    real honey of life. I want to be a lovable and respectable person as a teacher in the future.

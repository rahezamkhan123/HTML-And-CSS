    <h1>MY AIM IN LIFE</h1>
    <h2>A Sub Heading </h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify ;">An aim is a goal or objective to achieve in life. In order to succeed in life, one
        must have a goal. My aim in
        life
        is
        to be a teacher. Teaching is a noble and responsible profession. I have come to know that the ever-increasing
        misery
        and
        distress, are due to the ignorance and illiteracy of the people of our country. So I have decided to spread
        education
        among the masses as much as possible within my humble power. As a teacher, I shall try my best to impart
        man-making
        education. Some say that money is the honey of life. But I do not agree with them. Rather, I think that morality
        is
        the
        real honey of life. I want to be a lovable and respectable person as a teacher in the future.

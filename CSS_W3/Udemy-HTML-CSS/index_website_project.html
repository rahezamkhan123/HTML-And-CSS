        <p> Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering
            plants in
            the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted

            coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable produc, must be <a

            coffee, which

            before being filtered out, producing a
            cup of
            coffee.</p>
        <p> Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to
            its
            caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world[4] and can be prepared and presented
            in a
            variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually
            served
            hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to
            lessen the
            bitter taste or enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert, like
            doughnuts. A
            commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffeehouse or coffee shop (not
            to be
            confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).</p>
        <p> Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial as a stimulant
            in
            healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk of some diseases,
            although some of the long-term studies are of questionable credibility.</p>

    <h1>Making coffee </h1>
    <h2>Brewing</h2>
    <p> Brewed coffee is made by pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans, then allowing to brew. There are several
        methods for doing this, including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press. Terms used for the resulting
        coffee often reflect the method used, such as drip brewed coffee, filtered coffee, pour-over coffee, immersion
        brewed coffee, or simply coffee. Water seeps through the ground coffee, absorbing its constituent chemical
        compounds, and then passes through a filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter, while the
        brewed
        coffee is collected in a vessel such as a carafe or pot.</p>

    <p>Paper coffee filters were invented in Germany by <b>Melitta Bentz in 1908 </b>and are commonly used for drip brew
        all
        over the world. In 1954 the Wigomat, invented by<i> Gottlob Widmann</i>, was patented in Germany being the first
        electrical
        drip brewer.[2] Drip brew coffee makers replaced the coffee percolator in the 1970s due to the percolators'
        tendency
        to over-extract coffee, thereby making it bitter. One benefit of paper filters is that the used grounds and
        the
        filter may be disposed of together, without a need to clean the filter.</p>

        <h3 id="boiling"> Boiling </h3>

        <p> Coffee is always at the heart of hospitality, no matter the culture. But in Greece, boiled coffee is the
            mark of
            a thoughtful and considerate host. Guests feel welcomed because their coffee has been painstakingly prepared
            A host that serves the traditional coffee is also saying how much the friendship of the visitor means to
            them.
            While Greek coffee is served in small amounts, it's the conversation and the confectioneries that accompany
            the
            drink that makes the occasion.
            Oddly, in a world where everything is instant, it's the time, attention, and care, that explains why Greeks
            still boil their coffee.</p>

        <h3 id="steeping"> Steeping</h3>
        <p>Steeping is a process of creating coffee by adding ground coffee to hot water. It is one way to experience
            immersion brewing.</p>
        <p> Steeped coffee offers complexity in flavors as the coffee grounds remain in the hot water for more extended
            periods compared to the other coffee preparation methods. For a cup of hot coffee, just under five minutes
            us appropriate for steeping. It is also possible to create a cold brew while steeping coffee. However, to
            accomplish this you will need to leave the coffee grounds in the water for around 24 hours.</p>
        <p> For the best results, coarsely ground coffee should be used. Coarsely ground coffee is preferred to avoid
            having a cup of coffee that has coffee dust suspended within the liquid. This could lead to coffee dust
            settling at the bottom of the cup.</p>

        <h3 id="fillteration-methods">Fillteration Methods</h3>
        <p>Pour over and other manual brewing methods are my absolute favorites. There is something super interesting
            about brewing your coffee manually and making it taste better. Also one reason behind the better taste is
            that with manual brewing the process is much more precise and controllable. I actually gave my coffee brewer
            to a friend because I fell in love with manual brewing methods and noticed that I wasn't using my coffee
            brewer anymore. </p>
        <p>For all of these methods you will need a scale, a grinder, a water boiler, a timer and also a kettle comes in
            handy. Kettles are in many shapes and sizes but the most important factor is that the kettle has a goose
            neck so that the water distribution is as controllable as possible. </p>

        <h3 id="pressure">Pressure</h3>
        <p>In my own experience, the v60 produces quite a clean and balanced cup. There isnt going to be much sediment
            or coffee fat in your cup so the taste profile is quite often medium bodied. But you are able to alter that
            with your dripping technique. If you pour water slowly to the coffee bed, the water will run through the bed
            slower and make the cup have more body. On the other hand if you pour aggressively and fast, you will have
            lighter bodied cup. The most important rule is to pour evenly, preferably in circles, so that your coffee
            will brew evenly.</p>
